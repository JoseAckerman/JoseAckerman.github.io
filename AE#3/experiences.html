        <h1 class="w3-center">Changes in our lifestyle:</h1>
       <p>We can divide this subtopic into three different phases, which are:</p> <br>
       <h5> At the beggining of the pandemic: </h5>
       <p> This stage was the most difficult to handle, at least for me, during this time things changed completly and inmediately, from one day to another, anybody wasn´t able to go out from their houses, and if yo NEED to, you must do it using facemask, antibacerial gel, and respecting at least one metter from each person, from one day to another we weren´t able to come back to school, and we start using our computer as a classroom, this was near to spring break vacations, and nobody was able to go to the beach, a lot of things were cancelled, no more sport events nowhere, no more travels, no more school, no more parties, the only thing that was saving the teenagers were the xbox and tiktok. </p> <br>
       <h5> At the middle of the pandemic: </h5>
       <p> There was more knowledge of the virus and the measures we should take, things start to reactivate, the sport events are available again, but without fans, the nba playoff were played on a bubble, with only players, soccer is back, people came back to their jobs, using mask and having preventions, my parents let me see my friends again after many months, people was able to travel again, but it still was a risk of getting the virus, and there still was a lot of deaths</p> <br>
       <h5> At the end of the pandemic: </h5>
       <p> The start of applying the vaccine, kids are able to go back school, people is more relax right now, things are getting kind of as they was before all covid situation started </p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">Holidays: </h1>
       <p> 2020 winter vacations were different to any vacations before and also after, many things were different as their were before, all the family was using facemask, and in this season it was very common to give hugs and kisses, but in 2020 it was not possible, because we were taking care of my grandma and uncles, also, in that year, not all my cousins came to Culiacan, which is something that never happened before on those important dates </p>

  <h5> Supermarket: </h5>
  <p> During Covid-19 season, supermarket has been a place were many people has catched the virus, this because everyone needs to eat, so a lot of people goes to the supermarket, so, because of this there are many rules and updates of behaviour to be able to go</p> <br>
  <p> First of all, before you enter to the supermarket, there is someone cleaning the supermarket car, to be desinfected when you touch it, then there is a device on the entrance, which measures your body temperature, if you are to hot you can´t get in because that could be a sympthom, then there is another device on the entrance which gives you antibacterial gel, after this, you can get in and buy, inside you need to maintain distance from other people, and at the line to go pay, you need to step on a sticker which marks to be away 1.5 meters from the people in front and back to you. finally when you get where you pay their is a plastic barrier between you and the person that will charge you. </p> <br>
  <h5>Mass:</h5>
  <p> You need to always use facemask, there is social distance, one row could be use to sit down and the next one no, you cant give the peace touching others, unleast is from your family, and you can´t receive the Eucharist on the mouth, is on a hand and you should receive it at the moment</p>
